 ðŸ””**Question**: Have you ever made a mistake of overwriting a file or saving the wrong version?<br>
 
## Version Control<br>
 Imagine that youâ€™re collaborating with one of your labmates on a project. Youâ€™reboth making changes to functions in the codebase. At one point, you both havechanged the same lines in a particular function. How do you go about mergingyour changes so that youâ€™re both using the same code?<br>
 <br>
 This is why we use version control. **Version control** is a system that manages and recordschanges to files over time. The most commonly used version control system is called **Git** (others include Mercurial and SVN).

 `git` keeps track of the differences in the repository each time you make a change. The **entire** history of the repository is tracked by `git`. If you realize you made a mistake in your code, you can always roll it back to a previous timepoint.<br>
 In the personal workflow, you are largely going to be the only person adding to the repository. You have one **branch**, or version of your project: it'll likely be called the `main` branch. Every time you make changes to the code, you'll add them tothe `main` branch. 

 ## GitHub
 `git` is often used in tandem with acloud-based hosting platform - the most common is **GitHub** (but others includeGitlab and Bitbucket). GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. It allows you to store your Git projects in the cloud and provides a platform for collaborating with others. The benefit to using GitHub is that it makes it easier to collaborate on code with others via its web platform.<br>
 
 In this lesson, we're going to use the **GitHub Desktop Application** to make updates to a repository.<br>
 A **repository** (or repo for short) is a central place where all the files related to a project are stored. It includes your projectâ€™s code, documentation, and a record of every change made to the files over time, managed through a version control system like Git.

## Managing Local and Remote Repositories
We need to make a distinction between two kinds of repositories: there's the local repository and the remote repository. **The local repository** is the version of the code that is stored on your computer. **The remote repository**, meanwhile, is any version of the repository that lies on some other machine. In this context, remote repository is almost always going to refer to the version that is on on Github's servers. <br>

So, when we're making changes to a repository, there's two versions that need to stay in sync with each other: the local and the remote. The steps we outline keep track of those changes between both cases, while also keeping track of theentire history. Github provides a nice platform on which we can peruse the history of a repository.<br>

 Let's go through the process of making changes to a repository, step by step.<br>
### Creating a Repository 
To creating a new repository on Github, [link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) and follow the instructions on how to create a new repository on Github. Make sure to tick the `Add a README file` box under "Initialize this repository with". Click on `Create repository`. You now have a remote    repository (on Github's servers), but **not** a local repository.<br>

To create a new repository on GitHub Desktop, click `Current Repository`, and `add`. Click `Create New Repository`. Make sure to tick the "Initialize this repository with a README file". You now have a local repository but **not** a remote repository. `Publish repository` in order to put this newly created repository onto GitHub. 

## Personal Workflow<br>
  
 
 Each step in the Personal workflow is actually comprised of a set of smallersteps. Before we go through each step, we need to make a distinction between twokinds of repositories: there's the local repository and the remote repository.The local repository is easy: that's the version of the code that sits on yourcomputer. The remote repository, meanwhile, is any version of the repositorythat lies on some other machine. In this context, it's almost always going to refer to the version that sits on Github's servers.<br>
 
 
 
2. **Cloning.** We've done this with the `Bash-Git` repo. Cloning a repository   means taking a remote repository, and copying it to our local machine to   create a local repository. Let's clone the repo we just created. Open up a   terminal and run the command: `git clone [REPO-LINK]`, filling in the   `[REPO-LINK]` with the appropriate name provided by Github.<br>
 
3. **Checking the status.** A useful command to always run is `git status`. This   will provide a summary of what's going on in your repo. Run it to see what   happens - all it should say is that it's up to date with `origin/main`: this   means that it's up to date with `origin`, which is its name for the remote   repo. Within `origin`, it's synced to the `main` branch.<br>
 
4. **Making a change.** Let's make a change by creating a new file. Create a   file called `text.txt`, which has some text in it of your choosing. Then, run   `git status` and see what happens.<br>
 5. **Staging a change.** The first step to codifying this change in the `git`   history is to stage it, which is done with the `git add` command.   Once a change is "added", it is placed in a staging area. You can think of   this as a "proposal" for the next record in the Git history. The proposal is   made permanent in the following step. To add the file, run `git add test.txt`.<br>
    
*Note
*: "add" does not have the exact same meaning as the English word:   it actually means adding an operation. For instance, if we remove test.txt   locally by throwing it in the trash, and we then want to remove it from the   staging area and remote repo, we still do `git add test.txt`! <br>
 6. **Committing a change.** Next, once we've added all the changes we want to   the staging area, we need to commit them. Committing changes entails taking a   snapshot of them: once we do this, the changes are frozen and placed in the   `git` history. Each commit needs an accompanying message to say what the   reason for the commit is. Make sure these messages are informative - your   future self will thank you! Commit the file by running `git commit -m "adding   test file"`.<br>
 7. **Pushing to the remote.** Right now, the local repo knows about the changes   we did, but the remote repo doesn't. So, we need to synchronize the two by   "pushing" our changes to the remote repo. We can do this by running the   command `git push origin main`: we are pushing the changes we made to   `origin` (the name of the remote repo), on the `main` branch.<br>
 8. Check Github to see if the changes you made manifest on the website! You can   run a final `git status` for posterity's sake.<br>
 So, even in the personal workflow, there's a lot of individual steps needed justto make changes to the codebase. This becomes a little bit more complicated whenmultiple people are making changes at the same time, which requires a slightlydifferent workflow.<br>
 
# Collaborative Workflow<br>
 In the collaborative workflow, multiple people may be working on the samerepository at the same time. So we need to have a system in place for how todecide whose changes to add, and how to handle scenarios when changes may clashwith each other.<br>
 Collaborative workflows heavily rely on **branching**. We've already seen thisterminology in the context of the `main` branch. Now, we might be interested inadding a new feature to a code repository. When working collaboratively, wecreate a **branch** off the `main` repository. This branch can be updated inparallel, without modifying the `main` branch. When we've committed all thechanges to the feature branch, how do we go about incorporating them into the`main` branch?<br>
 ![](../img/collaborative.png)<br>
 With Github, we do a **Pull Request** (PR). In a PR, we are requesting the`main` branch to pull the changes from the feature branch into the `main`branch. Github provides a very nice platform to handle PRs - users can view thePRs, comment on them, and ask for changes. Once the maintainer of the repo issatisfied, they can merge the PR and the `main` branch is updated with thechanges in the feature branch.<br>
 The process of merging the changes in this way allows people to work in parallelon the `main` repo without modifying the `main` branch. Couple this withGithub's platform for handling PRs, and you have a powerful tool forincorporating parallel changes into a repository.<br>
 Let's give this a shot! You are going to make a change to an existing repositoryand submit a pull request for it. We'll be working in a repository called`Git-Playground` which is available on the D-Lab Github at [thislink](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Git-Playground).<br>
 
1. **Forking the repository.** An extra step you can take when working on a   collaborative repository is to **fork** the repo. This creates a copy of the   repository on your own Github account, which you're free to change at will.   You can still, however, pull changes from the original repo, and make pull   requests with your own changes. Go ahead and fork the repo that I just   created. See the image below for where to find the button:<br>
 ![forking](../img/fork.png)<br>
 
2. **Cloning.** Clone the forked repo to your local machine.<br>
 
3. **Branching.** Create a new branch on your local machine using the command   `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME` or `git branch -c BRANCH_NAME`.   Choose a branch name that feels appropriate to   you. Run `git status` afterward to see how things changed.   You can check out which branches you have, and which you are currently on,   by running `git branch`.<br>
 
4. **Commit a change.** Create a new file with some text, stage it, and commit   it.<br>

5. **Push the change.** Push the change on this branch to your remote repo.   You'll still use `git push`, but the command is slightly different: it will   be `git push origin BRANCH_NAME`. You're pushing to the remote (`origin`) on   the `BRANCH_NAME` branch.<br>

6. **Make the Pull Request.** Go to the `Git-Playground` repository on Github.   You should see something like the following image pop up. Github can already   tell you made a change, and gives you the option to make a pull request! If   you don't see this button, no worries - go to the "Pull Requests" button next   to Issues, and you can manually make one there. Follow the instructions for   making the pull request, and we'll merge a couple of them!<br>

# Removing git repositories<br>
 
* **Local:** If you want to delete local git-related information (like  branches and versions), all you have to do is delete the `.git` directory in  the root-directory of your repository. Note that `.git` directories are hidden  by default, so you'll need to be able to view hidden files to delete it.  If you want to delete everything (data, code, etc.), just delete the whole  directory.<br>
 
* **Remote** : If you want to delete a remote repository, navigate to GitHub andgo to Settings, then Danger Zone (at the bottom of the Settings page). Warning:Once you delete a repository, there is no going back.<br>
 
# Learning more<br>
 That's the workflow! There are other `git` practices we didn't cover - handlingmerge conflicts, rebasing, etc. As you get deeper into `git`, you can peruse theGithub documentation for tips on how to do these more advanced `git` commands.


 
 There are several different workflows in which you might imagine using `git`, particularly in an academic setting. These include:<br>
 
1. Working on a repository that is your own repo. You expect that you will generally be the only person developing code for this repository. <br>
2. Working on a repository that several people - perhaps some collaborators - are working on concurrently. <br>
3. Working on a repository that *many* people (e.g., at least dozens) are involved in. This may be, for example, an open-source project to which you contribute changes. We will not cover this approach in this workshop, as the details may be specific to the project you're working on. However, the principles from approach 
#2 hold here.<br>
